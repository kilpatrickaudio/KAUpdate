# KAUpdate

This is code for the original non-WebMidi KAUpdate software that was used for
a number of years by Kilpatrick Audio to allow users a simple way to update
their product firmware. As of 2020 it is no longer supported by Kilpatrick
Audio. We have now moved exclusively to a web-based tool using WebMidi. If
you are making a firmware updater you might want to check this out for ideas
on how to do it. Kilpatrick Audio may still have compiled packages available
for various operating systems but we do not plan to maintain those anymore,
so we are offering this here for future reference as to our MIDI update
procedure.

This program should be considered public domain software. The only rule is
that you must remove any references to Kilpatrick Audio or Andrew Kilpatrick
if you release your own version for another purpose. For personal use you
are free to use the code as-is.

Keep in mind that this software comes with no support or warranty.
